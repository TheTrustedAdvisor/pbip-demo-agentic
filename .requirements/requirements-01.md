# Business Requirements üíº

Create a new semantic model named 'TaxiRevenue' and ensure the following requirements are met:

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior |
|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **TAXI-001** | Total Revenue Performance Overview | As a **Fleet Manager**, I want to see the total revenue across all payment types and vendors so that I can understand our overall revenue performance. | Create a combined [Total Revenue] measure that sums Trip[FareAmount] + Trip[TipAmount] from the Trip table with proper relationship handling through shared dimensions. |
| **TAXI-002** | Revenue Growth Analysis | As **Executive Leadership**, I want to see year-over-year and month-over-month revenue growth percentages so that I can track business progress against targets. | Create time intelligence measures using SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR and PREVIOUSMONTH functions: [Revenue YoY Growth %] and [Revenue MoM Growth %] with proper Date table relationships. |
| **TAXI-003** | Top Performing Areas | As a **Operations Manager**, I want to identify the top 10 pickup locations by revenue so that I can optimize fleet deployment and focus on high-performing areas. | Create [Location Revenue Rank] measure using RANKX function and establish proper relationships between Trip and Geography tables for accurate location-level aggregations. |

# Visual Requirements üìä

Create interactive Power BI reports with the following visualizations to support the business requirements:

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior |
|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **VISUAL-001** | Executive Revenue Dashboard | As an **Executive**, I want a high-level dashboard showing key revenue metrics at a glance so that I can quickly assess taxi business performance. | Create a dashboard page with KPI cards showing [Total Revenue], [Revenue YoY Growth %], and [Revenue MoM Growth %]. Include trend sparklines and conditional formatting for growth indicators. |
| **VISUAL-002** | Revenue Trend Analysis | As a **Fleet Manager**, I want to see revenue trends over time with the ability to drill down by month/quarter so that I can identify seasonal patterns and performance trends. | Create a line chart showing daily/monthly revenue trends with year-over-year comparison. Include date hierarchy for drill-down capabilities and reference lines for targets. |
| **VISUAL-003** | Location Performance Ranking | As an **Operations Manager**, I want to see top performing pickup locations in an easy-to-read format so that I can quickly identify high-revenue areas and optimize fleet deployment. | Create a horizontal bar chart showing top 10 pickup locations by revenue with conditional formatting. Include city/county as a drill-through option from Geography table. |
| **VISUAL-004** | Payment Method Performance | As a **Finance Manager**, I want to compare revenue by payment type so that I can understand customer payment preferences and optimize payment processing. | Create a donut chart showing revenue distribution by payment type (using Trip[PaymentType] field) with percentage labels and drill-through to detailed payment analysis. |
| **VISUAL-005** | Interactive Revenue Explorer | As an **Analyst**, I want interactive filters and slicers so that I can explore data from different angles and time periods. | Add date slicer, city/county slicer (from Geography), and payment type filter. Ensure all visuals respond to slicer selections with cross-filtering. |

# Data source information üõ¢Ô∏è

- **Server**: Use parameter `Parameter_Server` (default: `if7l2k6jajhexaligopzadcdde-jqdtzkxghetune2a4f7mxsbodq.datawarehouse.fabric.microsoft.com`)
- **Database**: Use parameter `Parameter_Database` (default: `LondonTaxi`)
- **Connection Type**: Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse
- **Authentication**: Use organizational account or service principal
- **Data Description**: London Taxi trip data including pickup/dropoff locations, fare amounts, tips, payment methods, and temporal information

**Important**: The server and database values should be implemented as semantic model parameters to allow flexibility for different environments (dev/test/prod).

If you cannot connect to the Fabric Data Warehouse above to get the schema, all information of the Datawarehouse can be found in the file `AzureSQLSchema.csv`. 

# Development rules üßë‚Äçüíª

## Data Modeling Guidelines
- Analyze the datasource tables in `AzureSQLSchema.csv` and pick the tables that best answer the requirements. The main fact table is `Trip` with dimensions `Date`, `Geography`, `Medallion`, `HackneyLicense`, and `Time`.
- Use import storage mode for all tables (DirectLake mode can be considered for Fabric sources if performance is critical).
- Always prefer simple star-schema modeling. The Trip table should be the central fact table with relationships to dimension tables.
- Create a date relationship between Date dimension and Trip table using Trip[DateID] to Date[DateID]. Payment types are stored as string values in Trip[PaymentType].

## TMDL Implementation Rules
- Don't create a new Calendar table, make sure you reuse Calendar table in the TMDL file `.resources/tmdl/Calendar.tmdl` - you may rename columns but keep the structure exactly as-is. However, also import the Date table from the warehouse to leverage existing date relationships.
- The created TMDL tables should have the necessary columns and measures to answer the taxi revenue requirements using the actual schema: Trip, Date, Geography, Medallion, HackneyLicense, Time, Weather.
- All measures should be created in the Trip fact table TMDL file, but do not duplicate measures - they must be unique within the model.
- Make sure you set descriptions on all created measures using business language relevant to taxi operations.

## Parameter Configuration
- The server and database name MUST be implemented as semantic model parameters using this exact naming:
  - `Parameter_Server` for the server name
  - `Parameter_Database` for the database name
- Use these parameters in all Power Query data source connections

## Technical Guidelines
- Don't try to test the semantic model data during development
- For Fabric Data Warehouse connections, use proper authentication and consider security best practices
- Follow the PBIP file structure exactly as documented in the knowledge base

# Report Development rules üìä

## Visual Implementation Guidelines
- Create a comprehensive Power BI report (not just an empty report) that implements all visual requirements (VISUAL-001 through VISUAL-005)
- Follow Power BI design best practices: consistent color schemes, proper spacing, clear titles
- Use appropriate visual types for each data story:
  - KPI cards for metrics with trend indicators
  - Line charts for time-series analysis
  - Horizontal bar charts for rankings (better for long location names)
  - Donut charts for categorical distributions
- Implement proper drill-through and cross-filtering between visuals

## Interactivity & User Experience
- Add meaningful tooltips and conditional formatting where applicable
- Ensure all visuals respond to slicer selections with cross-filtering
- Include proper error handling for empty data scenarios
- Design for mobile-responsive layouts where possible

## Page Layout & Design
- Create a single comprehensive dashboard page that tells the complete taxi revenue story
- Use F-pattern layout (top-left to bottom-right reading flow)
- Maintain visual hierarchy with clear titles and consistent spacing
- Apply professional color scheme suitable for business presentations

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize DAX measures for performance
- Consider visual rendering performance with large datasets
- Test cross-filtering behavior across all visuals

# Semantic Model Naming conventions üè∑Ô∏è

- Use singular names for dimension tables (date, geography, medallion, hackneylicense, time)
- Use plural names for fact tables (trips)  
- All model object names should be lower case
- Don't use 'fact' or 'dim' in the table or column names. Prefer business friendly representation
- Don't use column names like 'geography name' prefer 'geography' instead
- Measure names should follow a consistent naming convention: 
  - [measure name] for base measure (e.g., [total revenue])
  - [measure name (ly)] for last year value of the base measure (e.g., [total revenue (ly)])
  - [measure name (ytd)] for ytd value for the base measure (e.g., [total revenue (ytd)])
  - Use taxi industry terminology where appropriate (e.g., [fare amount], [tip amount], [trip count])

# Table and Column Mapping Reference üìã

## Actual Schema Mapping:
- **Fact Table**: `Trip` (contains FareAmount, TipAmount, PaymentType, etc.)
- **Date Dimension**: `Date` (DateID, Date, Year, Month, Quarter, etc.)  
- **Location Dimension**: `Geography` (GeographyID, City, County, State, Country)
- **Vehicle Dimensions**: `Medallion` (MedallionID, MedallionCode) & `HackneyLicense` (HackneyLicenseID, HackneyLicenseCode)
- **Time Dimension**: `Time` (TimeID, HourNumber, DayTimeBucket, etc.)
- **Weather Dimension**: `Weather` (DateID, GeographyID, PrecipitationInches, AvgTemperatureFahrenheit)

## Key Relationships:
- Trip[DateID] ‚Üí Date[DateID]
- Trip[PickupGeographyID] ‚Üí Geography[GeographyID] 
- Trip[DropoffGeographyID] ‚Üí Geography[GeographyID]
- Trip[MedallionID] ‚Üí Medallion[MedallionID]
- Trip[HackneyLicenseID] ‚Üí HackneyLicense[HackneyLicenseID]
- Trip[PickupTimeID] ‚Üí Time[TimeID]
- Trip[DropoffTimeID] ‚Üí Time[TimeID]

## Revenue Calculation:
- **Total Revenue** = Trip[FareAmount] + Trip[TipAmount]
- **Payment Types** = Trip[PaymentType] (string values, no separate dimension)
- **Location Analysis** = Geography[City] or Geography[County] (no Borough field available)

# Validation & Quality Assurance üîç

## Pre-Development Checklist
