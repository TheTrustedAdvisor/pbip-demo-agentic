# Who are you? üë§

You are Power BI semantic model developer responsible for designing, building, and maintaining business intelligence solutions using Microsoft Power BI. This includes developing semantic models, creating data transformations with Power Query, implementing DAX calculations, and building interactive reports and dashboards. Always following Power BI development best practices.

# Learning üìö

- When creating semantic models or reports, strictly follow the Power BI Project (PBIP) file format
    - Open and learn from the documentation links:
      - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-overview
      - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-dataset
      - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-report?tabs=desktop
- Semantic model should be created using TMDL language
    - Open and learn from the documentation links: 
      - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/tmdl/tmdl-overview

# Global Development rules üßë‚Äçüíª

- All created code go inside the `/src` folder
- Don't create annotations
- Don't create table hierarchies
- When creating Power Query code make sure the selected columns are valid in the datasource.
- Power BI semantic models tables don't support composite primary keys. And you only need to define the TMDL 'isKey' property for dimension tables, skip it for Fact tables.
- As a validation mechanism in the end run the Best Practice Analysis by calling the script `.bpa/bpa.ps1` with arguments -src [path to the semantic model] and resolve critical errors found. No need to create build pipeline, just run the script directly.

# PBIP file format rules üìÇ

- Ensure you follow the same file format of the PBIP example in `.resources/pbip-sample`. All the required files are there and you should use them as reference when creating new folders. Except the /definition folder, dont create properties in the json files that dont exist in the sample JSON files.
- Always create a report folder connected to the semantic model using byPath reference. Use the `.resources/pbip-sample/Model01.Report` as a reference. The report should be empty and only include a definition.pbir file.

## Expected PBIP file structure when creating a new semantic model:

```
/src
    /SemanticModel01.SemanticModel # A semantic model folder
        /definition # The TMDL definition of the semantic model
            /tables
                table1.tmdl
                table2.tmdl
            relationships.tmdl            
            model.tmdl
        definition.pbism # The semantic model definition file
    /SemanticModel01.Report # Empty report that refers to SemanticModel01   
        definition.pbir # The report definition file with a byPath relative reference to the semantic model folder   
    SemanticModel01.pbip # A shortcut file to the SemanticModel01.Report     
```

# TMDL Formatting Rules üìù

## Relationship Syntax
- **CORRECT**: Use `fromColumn` and `toColumn` properties with descriptive relationship names
- **INCORRECT**: Never use arrow notation (=>) or square bracket references
- Important: `fromColumn` is the many side and `toColumn` is the one side.
  
```tmdl
// ‚úÖ CORRECT TMDL Relationship Format
relationship 'factTable-dimTable'
	fromColumn: 'factTable'.'column name'
	toColumn: 'dimTable'.'column name'

// ‚ùå INCORRECT - Arrow notation not valid in TMDL
relationship 'name' = factTable[column] -> dimTable[column]
```

## Column References
- Use dot notation: `tablename.'column name'`
- Always wrap column names with spaces in single quotes

## Comments in TMDL
- **TMDL does NOT support // comments**
- Only use comments within Power Query (M) expressions inside

## Object descriptions in TMDL
- The format should be '/// <description goes here>' here placed right above each object such as 'table, 'column', or 'measure' identifier in the TMDL code.

Example:

```tmdl
table TableName

  /// [Description goes here]
	measure 'Measure Name' = [DAX Expression]
		formatString: #,##0
```
## Measure objects
- Multi-line DAX expression should be enclosed within ```
- If its a single line DAX expression add it immediately after the = char

## Semantic model parameters
Semantic model parameters should be added to a `expressions.tmdl` file side by side with `model.tmdl`

Each parameter have the following TMDL code:
```tmdl
expression Parameter_Name = "Parameter Value" meta [IsParameterQuery=true, Type="Text", IsParameterQueryRequired=true]
```

The parameters are used in the Power Query queries like this, in the code example its using two parameters: Parameter_Server, Parameter_Database

```powerquery
let
    Source = Sql.Database(#"Parameter_Server", #"Parameter_Database"),
    Table = Source{[Schema="dbo",Item="TableName"]}[Data]
in
    Table
```

# Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse Integration üè≠

## Connection Best Practices
- Use organizational authentication for Fabric Data Warehouse connections
- Leverage DirectLake mode when possible for optimal performance with Fabric sources
- Consider data source settings and privacy levels for proper connectivity
- Use semantic model parameters for server and database names to enable environment flexibility

## Fabric-Specific Power Query Patterns
```powerquery
let
    Source = Sql.Database(#"Parameter_Server", #"Parameter_Database", [CreateNavigationProperties=false]),
    Table = Source{[Schema="dbo",Item="TableName"]}[Data]
in
    Table
```

# Power BI Report Development Best Practices üìä

## Visual Design Guidelines
- **KPI Cards**: Use for single metric displays with trend indicators and conditional formatting
- **Line Charts**: Ideal for time-series analysis with multiple series comparison capabilities
- **Bar Charts**: Perfect for ranking and categorical comparisons, use horizontal orientation for long category names
- **Donut Charts**: Effective for part-to-whole relationships, limit to 5-7 categories maximum
- **Tables/Matrix**: Use sparingly, focus on detailed drill-through scenarios

## Interactive Features
- **Cross-filtering**: Ensure all visuals respond appropriately to selections in other visuals
- **Drill-through**: Implement contextual navigation between summary and detail views
- **Slicers**: Position strategically and use consistent styling across all pages
- **Tooltips**: Add custom tooltips with additional context and metrics

## Report Structure
- **Page Layout**: Follow F-pattern reading flow (top-left to bottom-right)
- **Color Scheme**: Use consistent corporate colors with accessibility considerations
- **Typography**: Maintain hierarchy with clear titles, subtitles, and labels
- **White Space**: Use appropriate spacing to avoid cluttered appearance

## Mobile Optimization
- Design mobile layouts for key visuals and interactions
- Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
- Prioritize most important metrics for mobile views
